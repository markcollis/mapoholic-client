  "The core functionality of MapOholic is to provide an online home for scanned images of your orienteering maps, together with your routes if you have them (whether drawn manually, or captured with a GPS watch/tracker and drawn inÂ <0>QuickRoute</0>*). You can zoom in and rotate maps and switch easily between the plain course and your route. More than one map can be uploaded for an event, to allow for multi-part courses.": {

  "But there is much more to it than that. The maps can be linked to detailed information about the event and your performance, and you can quickly see how other users did at the same race. For Czech events registered on ORIS, event details, course details and results can be added automatically. You can also tag your maps in any way you like and add comments to both your own and other users' maps. The search filter matches event and map names, dates, places and the different types of tags so that your maps are easy to find.": {

  "<0>* QuickRoute is an excellent tool for processing GPS tracks. The JPG images of routes exported from it include track data and MapOholic can use this to determine the location of a map without needing to enter it manually. When you don't have a GPS track available, any graphics editor can be used to draw a route on a scanned map.</0>": {
