  "But there is much more to it than that. The maps can be linked to detailed information about the event and your performance, and you can quickly see how other users did at the same race. For Czech events registered on ORIS, event details, course details and results can be added automatically. You can also tag your maps in any way you like and add comments to both your own and other users' maps.": {

  "<0>* QuickRoute is an excellent tool and I use it for all races where I have a GPS track. The JPG images of routes exported from it include track data and MapOholic can use this to determine the location of a map without needing to enter it manually. When no accompanying GPS track is available, any simple graphics editor can be used to draw a route on a scanned map. Capturing and displaying vector route overlays is on the future feature list!</0>": {
